# Project Title: Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, demographic information, ticket class, etc. The goal is to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Libraries Used

### Pandas
**Pandas** is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which are essential for handling tabular data. Functions for reading/writing data, cleaning data (e.g., handling missing values), and transforming data (e.g., merging datasets) are provided.

### NumPy
**NumPy** is fundamental for numerical computing in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It's essential for performing calculations and data transformations.

### Matplotlib
**Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It offers a wide variety of plots, including line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, etc. It's highly customizable and suitable for generating publication-quality figures.

### Seaborn
**Seaborn** is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the creation of complex visualizations like heatmaps, violin plots, pair plots, etc., with minimal code. It also enhances Matplotlib's aesthetics and integrates well with Pandas data structures.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics using visual methods. It helps to uncover relationships, identify patterns, and detect anomalies or outliers in the data.

### Types of EDA
1. **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzes one variable at a time to describe its distribution and identify patterns. Common methods include histograms, box plots, and stem-and-leaf plots.
   
2. **Bivariate Analysis**: Examines the relationship between two variables. Common methods include scatter plots and correlation matrices.

3. **Multivariate Analysis**: Studies the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.
   - **Non-graphical methods**: Include cross-tabulation and statistical tests.
   - **Graphical methods**: Include scatter plots, multivariate charts, run charts, bubble charts, and heat maps.

### Ways to Perform EDA
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure the data is accurate and reliable for analysis.
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculate measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., to summarize numerical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Use graphs such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc., to visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Determine relationships between variables using correlation matrices, pair plots, or heatmaps.
